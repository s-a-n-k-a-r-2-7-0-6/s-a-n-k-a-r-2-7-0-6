Check out some of my projects:

- [Podcast-Relevant Segmentation System](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/podcast-segmentation):In my podcast-relevant segmentation project, I developed a system designed to automatically identify and segment casual conversations within podcast episodes. The primary focus was to distinguish between formal content and more relaxed, off-the-cuff discussions, allowing for better content categorization and targeted analysis. By implementing advanced NLP techniques, I was able to accurately detect and segment these casual conversations, making it easier to analyze and utilize the informal segments of the podcast. This project was crucial for improving the understanding of content dynamics and enhancing user engagement with podcast material.
- [Local RAG(Retrieval Augumented Generation](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/Local-RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-):In my Local RAG project, I developed a system using the GEMMA 7B model to enhance retrieval and generation processes for more contextually relevant information. By integrating retrieval mechanisms with advanced LLMs, I significantly improved the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses. This project showcases my ability to innovate by combining retrieval-based techniques with generative models in the field of AI.
- [LLM Projects](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/LLM-Projects): Projects and experiments related to natural language processing and LLMs,

Thanks for stopping by!
