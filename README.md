Check out some of my projects:

- [Podcast-Relevant Segmentation System](https://github.com/joecheriross/podcast-relevant-segment):In my podcast-relevant segmentation project, I developed a system designed to automatically identify and segment casual conversations within podcast episodes. The primary focus was to distinguish between formal content and more relaxed, off-the-cuff discussions, allowing for better content categorization and targeted analysis. By implementing advanced NLP techniques, I was able to accurately detect and segment these casual conversations, making it easier to analyze and utilize the informal segments of the podcast. This project was crucial for improving the understanding of content dynamics and enhancing user engagement with podcast material.
- [Local RAG(Retrieval Augumented Generation](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/Local-RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-):In my Local RAG project, I developed a system using the GEMMA 7B model to enhance retrieval and generation processes for more contextually relevant information. By integrating retrieval mechanisms with advanced LLMs, I significantly improved the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses. This project showcases my ability to innovate by combining retrieval-based techniques with generative models in the field of AI.In this project i have added the options in the users point of view as known my lappy could not handle the large pretrained model i have used smaller ones.
-  [Potato Disease Classification](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/potato-disease-prediction): In my Potato Disease Classification project, I developed a robust machine learning model to accurately identify and classify different diseases affecting potato leaves. The project involved building a system capable of distinguishing between healthy leaves and those affected by diseases such as Early Blight and Late Blight. By utilizing advanced image processing techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), I was able to achieve high accuracy in disease detection. This project plays a critical role in improving crop management practices, enabling farmers to take timely actions and reduce potential crop losses, thereby contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.

- [LLM Projects](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/LLM-Projects):**â€¢ Implemented PDFQuery System Using Gemini:** Developed an PDF reader system utilizing Gemini,where users provide a PDF as input. The
 system leverages Gemini to understand and process the PDF content,enabling users to query specific information and receive accurate answers
 based on the documentâ€™s content.

Thanks for stopping by!
