# Projects

## [Podcast-Relevant Segmentation System](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/podcast-segmentation)

In this project, I developed a system to automatically identify and segment casual conversations within podcast episodes. The focus was on distinguishing formal content from more relaxed discussions, enabling better content categorization and targeted analysis. By employing advanced NLP techniques, the system accurately detects and segments informal segments, enhancing the understanding of content dynamics and user engagement with podcasts.

## [Local RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/Local-RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-)

This project involves creating a system using the GEMMA 7B model to improve retrieval and generation processes. The integration of retrieval mechanisms with advanced LLMs enhances the accuracy and relevance of generated responses. Due to hardware limitations, I utilized smaller pre-trained models for user interactions, demonstrating my ability to innovate with AI techniques.


## [Data Analysis: Sales Insights](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/DATA-ANALYSIS-SALES-INSIGHTS)

This project involves analyzing sales data with MySQL and visualizing insights with Power BI. The process includes data cleaning and querying to uncover trends in customer transactions, revenue, and market performance. Interactive dashboards in Power BI provide visual insights that support strategic decision-making based on key sales metrics.

## [Personal Finance Analysis](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/personal-analysis/tree/main)

Developed a finance dashboard to track and analyze savings and expenditure over the past three years. It features interactive visualizations that reveal trends in savings, detailed expenditure breakdowns, and monthly and yearly financial summaries. The dashboard aids in effective financial management and decision-making through comprehensive data insights.
