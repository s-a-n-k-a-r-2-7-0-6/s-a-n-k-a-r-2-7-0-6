Check out some of my projects:

- [Podcast-Relevant Segmentation System](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/podcast-segmentation): Developed a system from scratch using trial-and-error methods to segment podcast content based on relevance.
- [Local RAG(Retrieval Augumented Generation](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/Local-RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-):In my Local RAG project, I developed a system using the GEMMA 7B model to enhance retrieval and generation processes for more contextually relevant information. By integrating retrieval mechanisms with advanced LLMs, I significantly improved the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses. This project showcases my ability to innovate by combining retrieval-based techniques with generative models in the field of AI.
- [LLM Projects](https://github.com/s-a-n-k-a-r-2-7-0-6/LLM-Projects): Projects and experiments related to natural language processing and LLMs,

Thanks for stopping by!
